## Sales Timing Implications

**Peak Assessment Season:** March through May is the dominant window nationally. ~90% of states administer their primary summative assessments during this period.

**Pre-Assessment Prep Season (Sales Opportunity):** January - February is when districts finalize test prep, remediation plans, and assessment logistics. This is a strong window for outreach around assessment-related products/services.

**Post-Assessment Data Season:** June - September is when results are returned and districts analyze performance data, set improvement goals, and plan interventions for the following year.

**Off-Cycle Opportunities:**
- Florida's multi-window model means assessment activity year-round
- HS EOC exams in TX, GA, OH, PA, VA, NY have December/winter windows
- Maine and Wyoming through-year models also create ongoing engagement points
