## 8. 90-Day Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Days 1-30 — Map the Landscape

- Assign territories across 50 states — divide customer book between FM and EK12 reps by state clusters
- Consolidate duplicate territory plans into unified FY27 plan set
- Merge EK12 customer book into Fullmind CRM (map EK12 accounts to NCES district IDs)
- Identify top 25 at-risk accounts for immediate retention outreach
- Build unified KPI dashboard for weekly board reporting

### Phase 2: Days 31-60 — Protect & Accelerate

- Lock renewals with existing customers — target 90%+ renewal rate across combined book
- Activate FY27 pipeline — move deals from discovery to proposal stage
- Launch service pilots for bookings-gap accounts (close delivery gap before June FY27 start)
- EK12 customer introductions: pair Fullmind service team with existing EK12 relationships
- Cross-sell play: introduce EK12 customers to Fullmind's broader service catalog

### Phase 3: Days 61-90 — Show Momentum

- Close first wave of FY27 deals — $5M combined pipeline conversion target
- Churn-warning outreach to all zero-pipeline churned accounts ($12.8M combined recovery opportunity — 90 EK12, 51 FM)
- Board-ready dashboard showing combined revenue trajectory and FY27 forecast confidence
- Territory assignment strategy finalized: state-cluster model with shared major accounts
- Weekly deal review cadence established across combined sales org

### Territory Assignment Strategy: Divide & Conquer

**Approach:**
- Group states into 4-6 territory clusters based on customer density and opportunity
- Assign primary rep per cluster — owns all accounts in the region
- Shared coverage for top-25 accounts that span multiple clusters
- EK12 reps keep existing relationships during 90-day transition

**Success Metrics:**
- 100% territory coverage within 30 days
- Zero accounts without a named owner by Day 45
- Renewal rate >= 90% across combined book
- $5M FY27 pipeline converted by Day 90
